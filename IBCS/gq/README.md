The tester I wrote for this one is just brute force. It does not use JUnit at all and instead uses the console. All it does is test for the integers within [-255, 255]. It also includes the method Mr. Allen used, except heavily adapted to fit the tester better. If lines 3 and 4 of the tester, remove the "gq."s on those lines.
